# Choose HTMX and avoid learning too much JavaScript.

This is a FastAPI project that shows you some of the basics of HTMX and how to serve it from FastAPI.

The example shows:
- login (with error message)
- detecting on the backend if htmx is used
- how to set a session id (Javascript)
- how to serve a dashboard via SSE (Server Sent Events)
- serving to out of bound elements
